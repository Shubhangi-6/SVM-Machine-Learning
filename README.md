# SVM-Machine-Learning
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM):**
  - A powerful machine learning algorithm for classification and regression tasks.
  - Based on the concept of finding the optimal hyperplane that separates different classes in a dataset.
  - Works well for both linear and non-linear data by using a kernel trick to map data into a higher-dimensional space.
  - Robust in high-dimensional spaces and effective in cases where the number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.
  - Capable of handling outliers effectively due to its reliance on support vectors.
  - Particularly useful in applications like image classification, text categorization, and bioinformatics.
  - Offers versatility through different kernel functions, including linear, polynomial, and radial basis function (RBF).
  - Achieves good generalization performance by maximizing the margin between classes.
  - Considered one of the go-to algorithms in the field of machine learning, widely used for both classification and regression problems.
